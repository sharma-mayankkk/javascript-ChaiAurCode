// console.log(2>3);
// console.log(3==3); // .. many more 


// //But here we can also compare the two different data types :

// console.log("3">2); //it converts the string into 
// console.log(2>"3");
// console.log("2" == 2); 

/*
now for the special case:
here it comes: the comparision operators and equality operator works differently.
so the summary is that the null is treated as 0 so the first two is false but when it comes to eqaulity check operator it only applies same data types.
but the last one has comparision operator so it is true.
*/
// console.log(null>0)
// console.log(null<0)
// console.log(null==0) 
// console.log(null>=0)

//For strict comparisions we use = = = triple assignment operator so we it only compares the same data types:
console.log("2" === 2)
